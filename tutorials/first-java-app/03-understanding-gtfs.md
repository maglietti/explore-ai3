# Understanding GTFS Data and Creating the Transit Schema

In this module, you'll learn about the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data format and how to model this data within Apache Ignite. You'll create a schema that enables efficient storage and querying of transit vehicle positions.

## The GTFS Format: Transit Data in Motion

The [General Transit Feed Specification](https://gtfs.org) (GTFS) has become the universal language of public transportation data. Created through a collaboration between Google and Portland's TriMet transit agency in 2006, it's now the industry standard used by transit agencies worldwide to share transit information in a consistent, machine-readable format.

GTFS comes in two formats:

```mermaid
graph LR
    GTFS[GTFS]
    GTFS --> Static[GTFS Static]
    GTFS --> Realtime[GTFS Realtime]
    
    Static --> Routes[Routes]
    Static --> Stops[Stops]
    Static --> Schedules[Schedules]
    Static --> Fares[Fares]
    
    Realtime --> VehiclePositions[Vehicle Positions]
    Realtime --> ServiceAlerts[Service Alerts]
    Realtime --> TripUpdates[Trip Updates]
    
    style GTFS fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style Static fill:#e6f3ff,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style Realtime fill:#ffebeb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
```

1. **GTFS Static**: The foundation of transit data, containing:
   - Route definitions (paths that vehicles travel)
   - Stop locations (where vehicles pick up passengers)
   - Schedules (when vehicles are expected at stops)
   - Fares (how much it costs to ride)

2. **GTFS Realtime**: The dynamic extension that provides near real-time updates:
   - Vehicle Positions (where vehicles are right now)
   - Service Alerts (disruptions, detours, etc.)
   - Trip Updates (predictions of arrival/departure times)

For our transit monitoring system, we'll focus on the **[Vehicle Positions](https://gtfs.org/documentation/realtime/reference/#message-vehicleposition)** component of GTFS Realtime. This gives us a continuous stream of data points showing where each transit vehicle is located, what route it's serving, and its current status (in transit, stopped at a location, etc.).

> [!note]
> GTFS-realtime data is typically delivered as Protocol Buffer messages, a binary serialization format developed by Google. While we won't delve into the details of Protocol Buffers in this tutorial, our client library will handle the parsing for us.

## Analyzing the Data: What's in a Vehicle Position?

Before designing our schema, let's examine what information is available in a GTFS vehicle position record:

| Field | Description | Example | Will We Use It? |
|-------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Vehicle ID | Unique identifier for the vehicle | "1234" | Yes - Primary key |
| Route ID | Identifier for the route the vehicle is servicing | "42" | Yes - For filtering |
| Trip ID | Identifier for the specific trip being made | "trip_morning_1" | No - Not needed for monitoring |
| Position | Latitude and longitude coordinates | (37.7749, -122.4194) | Yes - For mapping |
| Timestamp | When the position was recorded | 1616724123000 | Yes - Primary key component |
| Status | Current status of the vehicle | "IN_TRANSIT_TO", "STOPPED_AT" | Yes - For monitoring |
| Stop ID | Identifier of the stop if the vehicle is stopped | "stop_downtown_3" | No - Not needed for basic monitoring |
| Congestion Level | Level of traffic congestion | "RUNNING_SMOOTHLY" | No - Not in scope |
| Occupancy Status | How full the vehicle is | "MANY_SEATS_AVAILABLE" | No - Not in scope |

For our application, we'll focus on the most essential fields: vehicle ID, route ID, position coordinates, timestamp, and status. This gives us the core information needed for monitoring while keeping our schema clean and focused.

## Designing an Ignite Schema: Data Modeling Considerations

Before writing the schema creation code, let's consider the requirements for our transit data storage:

### 1. Time-Series Nature

Vehicle positions represent a time series â€“ sequential data points collected at regular intervals. Our schema must efficiently handle:

- Regular inserts of new position data
- Queries for the most recent position of each vehicle
- Historical queries over specific time ranges

### 2. Query Patterns

Our application will need to support several types of queries:

- Find all vehicles on a specific route
- Find the latest position of a specific vehicle
- Find all vehicles in a geographic area
- Find vehicles that haven't moved for a period of time

### 3. Scaling Considerations

As our transit system grows, the data volume will increase in two dimensions:

- More vehicles sending position updates
- More historical data accumulating over time

With these considerations in mind, let's design our schema.

## Creating the Ignite Schema: Using the Catalog API

Apache Ignite 3 provides a Catalog API for defining tables and their schemas in a type-safe manner. We'll use this API to create our vehicle positions table with the appropriate structure and indexing.

Let's create a `SchemaSetupService` class to handle the table creation:

```java
package com.example.transit.service;

import org.apache.ignite.client.IgniteClient;
import org.apache.ignite.catalog.ColumnType;
import org.apache.ignite.catalog.definitions.ColumnDefinition;
import org.apache.ignite.catalog.definitions.TableDefinition;
import org.apache.ignite.table.Table;

/**
 * Creates and maintains the database schema for the transit monitoring system.
 * This class handles the creation of tables using Ignite's Catalog API.
 */
public class SchemaSetupService {
    private final IgniteConnectionService connectionService;

    /**
     * Constructor that takes a connection service.
     *
     * @param connectionService The service that provides Ignite client connections
     */
    public SchemaSetupService(IgniteConnectionService connectionService) {
        this.connectionService = connectionService;
    }

    /**
     * Creates the database schema for storing vehicle position data.
     * This method is idempotent and can be safely run multiple times.
     *
     * @return true if the schema setup was successful
     */
    public boolean createSchema() {
        try {
            // Get the client connection from the connection service
            IgniteClient client = connectionService.getClient();

            // Check if table already exists
            boolean tableExists = false;
            try {
                // Try to directly get the table
                var table = client.tables().table("vehicle_positions");
                if (table != null) {
                    tableExists = true;
                    System.out.println(">>> Vehicle positions table already exists.");
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println("+++ Table does not exist: " + e.getMessage());
                // Continue with table creation
            }

            if (!tableExists) {
                // Define and create the table
                TableDefinition tableDefinition = TableDefinition.builder("vehicle_positions")
                        .ifNotExists()
                        .columns(
                                ColumnDefinition.column("vehicle_id", ColumnType.VARCHAR),
                                ColumnDefinition.column("route_id", ColumnType.VARCHAR),
                                ColumnDefinition.column("latitude", ColumnType.DOUBLE),
                                ColumnDefinition.column("longitude", ColumnType.DOUBLE),
                                ColumnDefinition.column("time_stamp", ColumnType.TIMESTAMP),
                                ColumnDefinition.column("current_status", ColumnType.VARCHAR)
                        )
                        // Define a composite primary key on vehicle_id and time_stamp
                        // This enables efficient queries for a vehicle's history
                        .primaryKey("vehicle_id", "time_stamp")
                        .build();

                System.out.println("=== Creating table: " + tableDefinition);
                Table table = client.catalog().createTable(tableDefinition);
                System.out.println("+++ Table created successfully: " + table.name());
            }

            return true;
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Failed to create schema: " + e.getMessage());
            Throwable cause = e;
            while (cause != null) {
                System.err.println("  Caused by: " + cause.getClass().getName() + ": " + cause.getMessage());
                cause = cause.getCause();
            }
            e.printStackTrace();
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

This schema creation code:

1. Checks if the table already exists to prevent errors
2. Uses Ignite's Catalog API to define a table with appropriate columns
3. Sets a composite primary key of `vehicle_id` and `time_stamp`
4. Handles errors with detailed reporting
5. Returns a success/failure indicator

> [!note]
> The `.ifNotExists()` method ensures the table creation statement won't fail if the table already exists. This makes our schema setup idempotent, meaning it can be run multiple times without causing errors or duplicate tables.

### Schema Design Decisions Explained

Let's take a closer look at some key decisions in our schema design:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class vehicle_positions {
        +VARCHAR vehicle_id
        +VARCHAR route_id
        +DOUBLE latitude
        +DOUBLE longitude
        +TIMESTAMP time_stamp
        +VARCHAR current_status
        
        PK(vehicle_id, time_stamp)
    }
```

1. **Composite Primary Key**:
   We defined a primary key consisting of `vehicle_id` and `time_stamp`. This allows us to:
   - Store multiple positions for the same vehicle (at different times)
   - Efficiently query the history of a specific vehicle
   - Enforce uniqueness for each vehicle's position at a given time

2. **Column Types**:
   - `VARCHAR` for string identifiers (vehicle_id, route_id, current_status)
   - `DOUBLE` for precise geographic coordinates
   - `TIMESTAMP` for temporal data, which allows for SQL time functions and comparisons

3. **Table Name**:
   We chose a clear, descriptive name (`vehicle_positions`) that follows SQL naming conventions.

> [!note]
> We didn't create separate secondary indexes in this schema since our query patterns will primarily use the composite primary key. In a production system, you might add additional indexes for specific query patterns, such as a spatial index for geographic queries or an index on `route_id` for filtering by route.

> - How the schema supports our query patterns

## Using the Schema

To verify our schema creation works correctly, let's implement an example class that creates the schema and performs basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

Create a file named `SchemaSetupExample.java`:

```java
package com.example.transit.examples;

import com.example.transit.service.IgniteConnectionService;

    /**
     * Main method to run the schema setup example.
     */
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Configure logging to suppress unnecessary output
        LoggingUtil.suppressLogs();

        System.out.println("=== Table Creation Example ===");

        System.out.println("=== Connect to Ignite cluster");
        try (IgniteConnectionService connectionService = new IgniteConnectionService()) {
            IgniteClient client = connectionService.getClient();

            // Create schema and verify with test data
            // Pass the connectionService to the SchemaSetupService constructor
            System.out.println("=== Create vehicle positions table");
            SchemaSetupService schemaSetup = new SchemaSetupService(connectionService);
            if (schemaSetup.createSchema()) {
                verifyTableWithTestData(client);
            } else {
                System.err.println("Table setup failed.");
            }

        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Table setup failed: " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("=== Table operations completed");

    }

    /**

            } else {
                System.out.println("Table not found in schema.");
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error checking if table exists: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }

    /**
     * Create a map with test vehicle data.
     *
     * @return Map containing test vehicle data
     */
    private static Map<String, Object> createTestData() {
        long currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        Map<String, Object> testData = new HashMap<>();

        client.sql().execute(null, insertSql,
                testData.get("vehicle_id"),
                testData.get("route_id"),

    }

    /**

        try (var resultSet = client.sql().execute(null, querySql, testData.get("vehicle_id"))) {
            int resultCount = 0;

            while (resultSet.hasNext()) {
                var row = resultSet.next();
                resultCount++;

                // Convert timestamp and display the result

        } else {
            System.out.println("Warning: Test data deletion may have failed.");
        }
    }
}
```

This example class performs a complete cycle of operations:

1. Connects to the Ignite cluster
2. Creates the schema using our `SchemaSetup` class
3. Inserts a test vehicle position record
4. Queries the record back to verify it was stored correctly
5. Deletes the test record
6. Verifies the deletion was successful
7. Cleans up resources

> [!note]
> Notice the conversion between Java's `Instant` and SQL's `TIMESTAMP` (represented as `LocalDateTime` in Java). This conversion is necessary because Ignite's JDBC driver expects temporal data in `LocalDateTime` format rather than as epoch milliseconds.

## The Architecture Behind the Schema

Our schema design follows several important principles that enable effective real-time transit monitoring while leveraging Apache Ignite 3's distributed architecture:

### Historical Tracking with Composite Primary Key

By using a composite primary key of `vehicle_id` and `time_stamp`, we can:

1. **Track complete vehicle histories**: Store multiple positions for each vehicle over time
2. **Efficiently find specific positions**: Quickly locate a vehicle's position at a particular time
3. **Enable time-series analysis**: Analyze movement patterns and service performance over time

```mermaid
graph TD
    VP[Vehicle Position]
    VP -->|Primary Key| VPID[vehicle_id + time_stamp]
    VP -->|Track| History[Historical Path]
    VP -->|Query| Latest[Latest Position]
    VP -->|Analyze| TimeSeries[Time Series Data]
```

### Data Colocation With Ignite 3

One of Apache Ignite 3's key features is data colocation, which places related data on the same cluster node. By using `vehicle_id` as the first part of our composite primary key, we enable efficient colocation of all position records for a single vehicle:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Ignite Cluster"
        subgraph "Node 1"
            V1[Vehicle 1001 Records]
            V2[Vehicle 1002 Records]
        end
        subgraph "Node 2"
            V3[Vehicle 1003 Records]
            V4[Vehicle 1004 Records]
        end
        subgraph "Node 3"
            V5[Vehicle 1005 Records]
            V6[Vehicle 1006 Records]
        end
    end
```

This colocation brings several significant benefits:

1. **Reduced network overhead**: When querying a vehicle's history, all data can be processed on a single node
2. **Faster aggregations**: Calculating metrics like average speed or total distance becomes more efficient
3. **Improved locality**: Data that's frequently accessed together stays together
4. **Better scaling**: As the fleet grows, new vehicles' data distributes evenly across the cluster

For example, when tracking a specific vehicle's path over time, Ignite can execute the query entirely on the node containing that vehicle's data, avoiding costly network transfers between nodes.

> [!note]
> The first part of a composite primary key (in our case, `vehicle_id`) is used as the affinity key by default in Ignite. This means data with the same vehicle ID will be stored on the same node, optimizing queries that search for a specific vehicle's history.

## Executing the Schema Example

To run the schema example:

```bash
mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.transit.examples.SchemaSetupExample"
```

When executed successfully, you'll see output confirming the schema creation, record insertion, query, and deletion operations. This validates that your Ignite cluster is correctly configured for storing transit data.

> **Expected Output**: You should see successful connection, table creation, record insertion, querying, and deletion messages. The test should complete with "Test completed, resources cleaned up."

> [!important]
> **Checkpoint**: After running the schema example:
>
> - Verify all operations (create, insert, query, delete) completed successfully
> - Check that no exceptions were thrown during the test
> - Ensure the connection was properly closed at the end

## Common Data Modeling Patterns for Time-Series Data

Our transit monitoring application follows common patterns for modeling time-series data in distributed databases:

1. **Composite Keys**: Using a composite key of entity ID + timestamp creates a natural order for time-series data
2. **Column Families**: Grouping related data fields together (vehicle information, location, status)
3. **Data Colocation**: Ensuring related time-series points are stored together
4. **Time-Based Partitioning**: As data grows, it can be partitioned by time ranges

These patterns apply beyond transit monitoring to many time-series applications, including IoT monitoring, financial trading data, and performance metrics.

2. Created a Java model for vehicle positions
3. Designed an efficient schema using Ignite's Catalog API
4. Implemented and tested basic CRUD operations
5. Learned about the distributed architecture supporting your application

This schema provides the foundation for our transit monitoring system. In the next module, we'll build a client to fetch real-time GTFS data from a transit agency and feed it into our Ignite database.

> [!important]
> **Final Module Checkpoint**: Before proceeding to the next module, ensure:
>
> - You understand the schema design and its relationship to the data model
> - The schema creation test runs successfully
> - You can explain how the composite primary key helps with data organization and query performance
> - You understand how Ignite's data colocation feature improves query performance

> [!tip]
> **Next Steps:** Continue to [Module 4: Building the GTFS Client](04-gtfs-client.md) to implement the component that will connect to real-time transit data feeds.
